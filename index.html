        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>After graduating high school in the summer of 2009, I joined the <span id="usmc">United States Marine Corps</span> where I served as a <span id="usmc_mos">data network specialist</span>. This jump started my career into technology, where I learned building and managing servers, networking, information security, and much more.</p>
        <p>After leaving the Marines in 2014, I briefly attended <em><strong>Academy of Arts University</strong></em> where I studied Game Design, mainly working with JavaScript in the Unity engine, as well as 3D modeling, story writing, and some art classes. I stopped attending shortly after I started working as a <em><strong>systems support technician</strong></em>, where I continued my previous career in technology, working with back end systems and supporting users.</p>

        <p>As much as I loved my job, I felt like I wasn't being my best self. There was a creative side of me that I wanted to tap into, however, working in IT, you don't get many oppurtunities to be creative. Every now and then I'd get to do some coding, or build a layout with HTML to make it easier for our technicians and users to read and understand what the details were on tickets that were emailed to them. I loved that I was able to use logical thinking while also creatively playing with ways to make everything look pleasing to the eye.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until 2021 that I decided to take that first step, and truly make a change in my life. As scary as it can be to do a career change, I felt like it was necessary in order to improve my quality of life as well as leave my mark on the internet, and express myself creatively.</p>
        <p>I started with <em><strong>Codecademy</strong></em>, learning front-end development, building websites and learning HTML & CSS. A few months after that, I applied to <em><strong>Flatiron School</strong></em>, where I could really commit to my career change for once, take control of my life and see how far I can really go.</p>
